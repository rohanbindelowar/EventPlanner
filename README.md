# EventPlanner
# Problem & Need:	
In today's circumstances, people struggle to find reliable event planners, and event planners themselves are facing economic hardships. Therefore, there's a demand for an app that can locate high-quality event planners who are affordable and can ensure the success of events. To address these issues, we're developing a web app to assist both groups. Some of the problems which our app solves:
  ### Budget Concerns:
  Individuals and organizations often have budget constraints when it comes to event planning. The fear of exceeding budgets or uncertainty about the overall cost of professional planning services can deter them from seeking expert assistance. 
  ### Time-Consuming Process:
  Event planning involves a multitude of tasks, from creating guest lists to coordinating with vendors and ensuring seamless logistics. This complex and time-consuming process can overwhelm even the most enthusiastic event organizers.
  ### Visibility Challenges: 
  Talented and affordable event planners exist, but they often struggle to gain visibility and connect with potential clients due to limited marketing resources. This lack of exposure results in potential clients missing out on cost-effective planning options.
  ### Trustworthiness: 
  Trust is a fundamental component of event planning. People need a trustworthy platform that can match them with experienced event planners who have a proven track record of delivering successful events. Without such a resource, the risk of hiring inexperienced planners or falling victim to scams remains a constant concern.
