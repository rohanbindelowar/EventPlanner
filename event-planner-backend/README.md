## Backend

You need to run the backend first, then run the front end. The website will work properly only after both
the frontend and backend are running at the same time. Otherwise, there might me unexpected errors.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This will install all the dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
